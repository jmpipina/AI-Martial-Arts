_A state-of-the-art computer vision classifier adapted to the martial arts realm_


For an overview and write-up of the project, see [this link](https://jmpipina.github.io/martial.html).

For a shortened version of the code (with reduced output for clarity), see the .ipnyb file above. Note that this file is not intended to be run, since the contents of the drive folder (for example, the created custom dataset) are not provided. The intention is only to show some example code of how the project was approached.

For any questions, feel free to contact me :)
